                Canada's elementary schools offer a nurturing environment where
                children begin their academic journey under the guidance of
                world-class educators. Typically, students attend elementary or

                    Canada ranks among the global leaders in education quality,
                    especially in reading, mathematics, and science. This
                    success stems from passionate, highly qualified teachers who
                    foster engaging and innovative learning environments.
                    Educators in Canada hold at least a bachelor's degree,
                    complete practical training, and often pursue master's-level
